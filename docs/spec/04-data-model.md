# Ebrostay Reconstruction Spec — §4 Data Model
> Baseline: as-built (branch `main`, 2026-06-25; refreshed 2026-07-19 after a spec-vs-code audit). Status tags: ✅ active · 🔜 planned/unwired · 🗑️ dormant-to-remove · 🐞 suspected bug · 🚫 out-of-scope (MVP).

This section is the authoritative description of the Ebrostay persistence layer. It
covers every table in the `public` schema, the `property-photos` storage bucket, the
`auth.users` touchpoints, and all constraints, defaults, and relationships needed to
recreate `schema.sql` (plus the `upgrade-2026-06-*.sql` migrations) **exactly**.

Conventions:

- **PK** = primary key, **FK** = foreign key. "NOT NULL" means the column is required.
- Money columns are euros. `numeric(10,2)` stores cents precisely; `integer` columns
  store whole euros only.
- All `*_at` timestamps are `timestamptz` (UTC with offset).
- Text marked `_es` / `_en` is the Spanish / English version of the same field.
- Per-table **RLS summary** is one line here; the **full policy text lives in §8
  (Auth & security model)** — this section only names who reads/writes each table.
- RLS legend: 🟢 anyone incl. anonymous · 👤 the authenticated owner of the row ·
  🧑‍💼 property owner · 🛡️ admin · 🔧 service role (Edge Function, bypasses RLS).

> **Migration provenance.** The base `supabase/schema.sql` creates `properties`,
> `availability_blocks`, `profiles`, `favorites`, `bookings`, `inquiries`,
> `property_photos`, and the storage bucket. The tables `booking_requests`,
> `owner_leads`, `owner_payout_details`, `property_guest_info`, the
> `profiles.is_owner` and `properties.address` columns, the `availability_blocks`
> hold/`user_id` columns, the `bills_policy`/stay-detail columns, the
> `availability_no_overlap` GiST constraint, and the `owner_payout_details` /
> `property_guest_info` policies are layered on by `upgrade-2026-06-*.sql`. A
> from-scratch rebuild should apply all of them; the consolidated end-state is what
> this section documents.

## 4.1 Entity-relationship overview

All foreign keys at a glance. Cardinality is read "child → parent".

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 🟢 published rows, 🛡️ all, 🧑‍💼 own (`owner_id = auth.uid()`). WRITE — 🛡️ admins only; unpublishing is the soft-hide.

---

## 4.3 Table: `availability_blocks` ✅

Date ranges when a property is **not** bookable: confirmed stays, manual blocks, or
temporary holds. Also how an admin assigns a stay to a tenant ("Mis reservas").

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | NOT NULL | `gen_random_uuid()` | **PK.** | `7a1b…` |
| `property_id` | text | NOT NULL (FK→properties) | — | Which property is blocked. Deletes cascade. | `pedro1` |
| `start_date` | date | NOT NULL | — | First blocked day (inclusive). | `2026-07-04` |
| `end_date` | date | NOT NULL | — | Last blocked day (inclusive). Must be `>= start_date`. | `2026-07-10` |
| `note` | text | yes | — | Optional admin note about the block. | `Reforma cocina` |
| `user_id` | uuid | yes (FK→profiles) | — | Tenant this stay is assigned to; null = admin-only block. Detaches (set null) if the profile is deleted. | `8f3c…` |
| `hold_expires_at` | timestamptz | yes | — | Null = **confirmed** block. A future timestamp = **temporary hold** (filtered out client-side once expired). | `2026-06-25T11:30:00Z` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | Row creation time. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**Constraints:**

- `valid_range` — `check (end_date >= start_date)`.
- `availability_no_overlap` — **GiST exclusion constraint**: two *confirmed* blocks
  (`hold_expires_at IS NULL`) for the same property may not overlap. Defined on
  `daterange(start_date, end_date, '[]')` (inclusive of both ends) with `property_id`
  equality, partial `WHERE hold_expires_at IS NULL`. Requires the `btree_gist`
  extension. **Holds are exempt** (they can overlap each other and confirmed blocks).

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 🟢 everyone (`using (true)`), so blocked dates
render for logged-out visitors. WRITE — 🛡️ admins only; the booking-request flow does
**not** insert blocks — an admin creates them manually when accepting a request.

> 🐞 Because READ is public, `user_id` (which tenant a stay is assigned to) is
> world-readable — it exposes that *a* booking exists, though only as a uuid. Tracked
> as a security note in §8.

---

## 4.4 Table: `profiles` ✅

One row per registered user, auto-created on signup by the `handle_new_user` trigger.
PK equals the `auth.users` id.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | NOT NULL (FK→auth.users) | — | **PK** = the Supabase Auth user id. Deletes cascade. | `8f3c…` |
| `email` | text | yes | — | User's email, copied from `auth.users` at signup. | `tenant@example.com` |
| `is_admin` | boolean | NOT NULL | `false` | Grants admin panel + admin RLS. Set manually in SQL. | `false` |
| `is_owner` | boolean | NOT NULL | `false` | Grants the owner portal. Set when a property is assigned to them. (Added via migration.) | `true` |
| `deactivated_at` | timestamptz | yes | — | When the user self-deactivated. Non-null = account disabled (records kept). | `2026-06-20T09:00:00Z` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | Profile creation time. | `2026-06-01T08:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 👤 own (`auth.uid() = id`), 🛡️ all. WRITE — **no
client write policy.** Rows are created by the `handle_new_user` trigger (🔧 security
definer); the only mutations are via security-definer RPCs (`deactivate_my_account()`,
`admin_delete_user()`). A user **cannot** edit their own profile (incl.
`is_admin`/`is_owner`) from the client — this is what blocks privilege escalation with
the public anon key.

---

## 4.5 Table: `favorites` 🚫

> 🚫 **Out of scope for MVP (removed 2026-06-25).** The favorites / saved-homes feature (heart toggle, saved-only filter, `favorites` table sync, header *Guardados* link) has been removed from the MVP build. This section documents the deferred design only; none of it is wired in the current build.

A user's saved homes. Composite PK `(user_id, property_id)` = one row per saved home.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `user_id` | uuid | NOT NULL (FK→auth.users) | — | Who saved it. Part of PK. Deletes cascade. | `8f3c…` |
| `property_id` | text | NOT NULL (FK→properties) | — | The saved property. Part of PK. Deletes cascade. | `movera1` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | When it was saved. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 👤 own only (`auth.uid() = user_id`); admins have
**no** read policy here. WRITE — 👤 own **insert** and **delete** only; no update policy
(toggling a favorite is an insert or a delete, never an update).

---

## 4.6 Table: `booking_requests` 🔜

> **STATUS: 🔜 planned / unwired.** This is the intended live booking record for the
> no-online-payment flow. Rows are written **only** by the `request-booking` Edge
> Function (service role), which computes fees server-side — but that path is **not
> currently wired into the UI** (the MVP booking flow uses mailto/WhatsApp). Keep the
> table and policies; treat the write path as planned, not active.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | NOT NULL | `gen_random_uuid()` | **PK.** | `c2d4…` |

| `start_date` | date | NOT NULL | — | Requested check-in. | `2026-08-01` |
| `end_date` | date | NOT NULL | — | Requested check-out (exclusive). | `2026-10-01` |
| `months` | integer | yes | — | Billed whole months (server-computed). | `2` |
| `rent_eur` | numeric(10,2) | yes | — | months × `price_number`. | `1900.00` |
| `commission_eur` | numeric(10,2) | yes | — | `min(15% of rent, one month's rent)`. | `285.00` |
| `deposit_eur` | numeric(10,2) | yes | — | Refundable deposit (from `deposit_amount`). | `950.00` |
| `total_eur` | numeric(10,2) | yes | — | `rent + commission + deposit`. | `3135.00` |
| `tenant_names` | text | yes | — | Free text of tenant names (one per line), max ~800 chars. | `Jane Doe\nJohn Roe` |
| `status` | text | NOT NULL | `'new'` | Lifecycle. `new` → `contacted` → `confirmed` / `declined`. | `new` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | When the request came in. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 👤 own (`auth.uid() = user_id`), 🛡️ all. WRITE —
**no client insert policy.** Rows written exclusively by the `request-booking` Edge
Function (🔧 service role) after computing fees; 🛡️ admins may **update** (status
transitions). No delete policy.

---

## 4.7 Table: `bookings` 🗑️

> **STATUS: 🗑️ dormant — to remove.** Legacy table for *paid Stripe bookings*. Written
> only by the (currently inactive) Stripe webhook via service role; online payment has
> been removed from the product. Surfaced read-only in account/owner/admin views.
> Slated for removal in the rebuild — reproduce only if preserving the as-built schema.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | NOT NULL | `gen_random_uuid()` | **PK.** | `a1b2…` |

| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | Row creation time. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 👤 own, 🛡️ all, 🧑‍💼 owner of the property
(`exists` on `properties.owner_id = auth.uid()`). WRITE — 🔧 service role only (Stripe
webhook); no client policy. Currently dormant.

## 4.8 Table: `inquiries` ✅

Contact-form leads. Anyone (incl. anonymous) may insert; only admins read.

## 4.9 Table: `owner_leads` ✅

"Become a partner" applications from property owners. Anyone may insert; admins read.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |

## 4.10 Table: `owner_payout_details` ✅

Bank/payout details for an owner. PK = `owner_id` (one row per owner). Contains
sensitive financial data (IBAN, tax id); policy is deliberately tight.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owner_id` | uuid | NOT NULL (FK→profiles) | — | **PK.** The owner these details belong to. Deletes cascade. | `8f3c…` |
| `account_holder` | text | yes | — | Name on the bank account. | `Carlos Pérez` |
| `iban` | text | yes | — | IBAN, stored uppercase with whitespace stripped. | `ES9121000418450200051332` |
| `bank_name` | text | yes | — | Bank name. | `CaixaBank` |
| `tax_id` | text | yes | — | Tax identifier (NIF/CIF/VAT). | `12345678Z` |
| `billing_address` | text | yes | — | Billing address for payouts/invoices. | `Calle Mayor 1, Zaragoza` |

| `updated_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | Last update time. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 🧑‍💼 own (`auth.uid() = owner_id`), 🛡️ all (admins
verify payout details). WRITE — 🧑‍💼 owner manages own row (`for all` with
`auth.uid() = owner_id`); admins are **read-only** here (they cannot edit an owner's
bank details).

## 4.11 Table: `property_photos` ✅

Image metadata; the files themselves live in the public `property-photos` storage
bucket. World-readable; admin-only write. Index `property_photos_property_idx` on
`(property_id, sort_order)`.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | uuid | NOT NULL | `gen_random_uuid()` | **PK.** | `f6a7…` |
| `property_id` | text | NOT NULL (FK→properties) | — | Which property the photo belongs to. Deletes cascade. | `pedro1` |
| `storage_path` | text | NOT NULL | — | Path within the `property-photos` bucket; resolved to a public URL client-side. | `pedro1/1718000000-kitchen.jpg` |
| `sort_order` | integer | NOT NULL | `100` | Display order (ascending). Lowest = cover. Reorder renumbers to 10, 20, 30… | `10` |
| `is_floorplan` | boolean | NOT NULL | `false` | `true` = floor plan (shown in its own section, excluded from the gallery). | `false` |
| `created_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | Upload time. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 🟢 anyone (`using (true)`). WRITE — 🛡️ admins only
(`for all` with `is_admin()`). The image files follow the same rule (see §4.13).

---

## 4.12 Table: `property_guest_info` ✅

Tenant-only stay information, never shown in public search. PK = `property_id` (one row
per property). **This is the field-level-privacy table** — sensitive arrival details
(WiFi password, key codes) live here, separate from the public `properties` row,
precisely so they can be hidden by a row policy.

| Field | Type | Null? | Default | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `property_id` | text | NOT NULL (FK→properties) | — | **PK.** The property this info is for. Deletes cascade. | `pedro1` |
| `wifi_name` | text | yes | — | WiFi network name (SSID). | `Ebrostay_Pedro1` |
| `wifi_password` | text | yes | — | WiFi password (shown to the guest in monospace). | `Zaragoza2026!` |
| `key_pickup` | text | yes | — | Key pickup / entry instructions. | `Lockbox junto a la puerta, código 4821` |
| `checkin_time` | text | yes | — | Check-in time (free text). | `15:00` |
| `checkout_time` | text | yes | — | Check-out time (free text). | `11:00` |
| `emergency_phone` | text | yes | — | Emergency contact phone (shown as a tel: link). | `+34 600 123 456` |
| `notes` | text | yes | — | Any extra arrival notes. | `Basura: contenedor verde en la esquina.` |
| `updated_at` | timestamptz | NOT NULL | `now()` | Last update time. | `2026-06-25T10:00:00Z` |

**RLS (summary; full text §8):** READ — 🛡️ admins read all; 👤 a guest reads the row
**only for a property they have a stay on** — an `exists` check against either
`bookings` (a paid booking) **or** `availability_blocks` (an admin-assigned stay) where
`user_id = auth.uid()`. A random logged-in user gets nothing back. WRITE — 🛡️ admins
only (`for all` with `is_admin()`).

---

## 4.13 Storage bucket: `property-photos` ✅

Not a table, but part of the data model. Public bucket
(`storage.buckets` row `id = name = 'property-photos'`, `public = true`) holding the
actual image files referenced by `property_photos.storage_path`. RLS policies are on
`storage.objects`, each scoped with `bucket_id = 'property-photos'`.

- **READ** — 🟢 anyone (`Public read property photos`, `using (bucket_id = 'property-photos')`). URLs are public.
- **WRITE** — 🛡️ admins only for insert, update, and delete (each policy ANDs
  `bucket_id = 'property-photos'` with `is_admin()`).

Full policy text in §8.

## 4.14 Auth-managed: `auth.users` touchpoints

`auth.users` is managed by Supabase Auth and lives outside the `public` schema. The app
touches it only indirectly:

- `profiles.id` mirrors `auth.users.id` (1:1; the signup trigger creates the profile).
- `favorites.user_id` and `inquiries.user_id` FK **directly** to `auth.users.id`.
- `deactivate_my_account()` sets `auth.users.banned_until` (= `now() + 100 years`).
- `admin_delete_user()` deletes the `auth.users` row (cascading to `profiles`).

Fields the app relies on: `id` (uuid), `email`, `banned_until`.

### Privileged functions (who may execute)

These `security definer` RPCs run with elevated rights, so their **`execute` grant** is
the access control — they are revoked from `public`/`anon` and granted narrowly. Full
bodies and security analysis are in §8.

| Function | Who may call | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `handle_new_user()` | trigger only (not callable) | Creates the `profiles` row at signup (`on conflict (id) do nothing`). Fires `after insert on auth.users`. |
| `is_admin()` | used inside policies | Returns whether the caller is an admin (`security definer`, `stable`; avoids RLS recursion). |
| `deactivate_my_account()` | 👤 authenticated | Sets own `deactivated_at` and bans own auth user 100 years. Raises if not signed in. |
| `admin_delete_user(uuid)` | 👤 authenticated, but **body checks `is_admin()`** | Hard-deletes a user; refuses if the target is an admin (`cannot delete an admin account`). |

> Note `admin_delete_user` is *granted* to all authenticated users but **guards itself**
> with an `is_admin()` check inside the body (raising `not allowed` otherwise) — worth
> an explicit negative test (§10).

## 4.15 Constraints & indexes summary (for an exact rebuild)

| Object | On table | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `properties_pkey` | `properties` | PK on `id` (text). |
| `bills_policy` CHECK | `properties` | `bills_policy in ('included','capped','excluded')`. |
| `valid_range` CHECK | `availability_blocks` | `end_date >= start_date`. |
| `availability_no_overlap` EXCLUDE | `availability_blocks` | GiST: `property_id WITH =`, `daterange(start_date,end_date,'[]') WITH &&`, `WHERE hold_expires_at IS NULL`. Needs `btree_gist`. |
| `favorites_pkey` | `favorites` | Composite PK `(user_id, property_id)`. |
| `profiles_pkey` | `profiles` | PK on `id`; FK → `auth.users(id)` cascade. |
| `owner_payout_details_pkey` | `owner_payout_details` | PK on `owner_id`. |
| `property_guest_info_pkey` | `property_guest_info` | PK on `property_id`. |
| `bookings_stripe_session_id_key` | `bookings` 🗑️ | UNIQUE on `stripe_session_id` (idempotency). |
| `property_photos_property_idx` | `property_photos` | INDEX on `(property_id, sort_order)`. |
| FK cascades | (various) | `cascade` on `properties`/`profiles` children listed in §4.1; `set null` on `*_id` snapshot FKs. |

## 4.16 Notes for the test plan

- **Money math lives in two places** (`property.js` client estimate and the
  `request-booking` Edge Function 🔜) but only the Edge Function writes the `*_eur`
  columns — assert those against the displayed estimate. (Algorithm parity: §5.)
- **Snapshot columns** (`property_name`, `customer_email`, etc. in `booking_requests` 🔜
  / `bookings` 🗑️) intentionally duplicate data so records survive property/account
  deletion. Tests should **not** expect them to update after edits.
- **`bills_included` vs `bills_policy`**: `bills_policy` is authoritative; `bills_included`
  is legacy. Seed/staging data should keep them consistent.
- **Holds vs confirmed blocks**: only `hold_expires_at IS NULL` rows are
  overlap-protected (by `availability_no_overlap`) and count as truly unavailable
  server-side. Expired holds are filtered client-side, not deleted.
- **FK-target divergence** (`favorites`/`inquiries` → `auth.users`; everything else →
  `profiles`): include a cascade test that deletes a user and checks both behaviors.
- **Negative RLS cases** (a random user reading `property_guest_info`,
  `admin_delete_user` against an admin, favorites cross-read) are enumerated in §10
  with full policy reasoning in §8.
